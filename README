Prototype for testing network connections and graphics for the Swarms game

The prototype was tested on Windows 7 Enterprise SP1, JDK 1.7.6 and JDK 1.7.7.
LWJGL 2.8.4 library is used (LWJGL dll files are included to github project).

The following JAVA VM options should be defined in project settings:
-Djava.library.path=lib\natives-win32  -Dorg.lwjgl.opengl.Display.allowSoftwareOpenGL=true
This allows the lwjgl library to find the right dll files.

Also, be sure that the entire lib folder is included in the dependencies section of the project.

IMPORTANT!
If you are using a 32 bit version of java, then you must use the 32 bit dll files, which
are not included in the project because they are incompatible with our 64 bit installation.
You must go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/LWJGL%202.8.4/
and download the latest version of lwjgl. Then copy the 4 32-bit dll files into lib/natives-win32 and
remove the 64-bit dll files.
